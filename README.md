## about revmp.

**revmp.** is a lightweight modpack built for people who just want Minecraft to run better without all the extra noise.  
  
it’s built around simple optimizations — better rendering, faster startup, smoother performance — while keeping the game basically vanilla.  
  
no crazy changes, no bloated features. just the good stuff that makes everything faster and cleaner.
